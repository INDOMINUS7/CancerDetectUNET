# CancerDetectUNET
This project involves the analysis and visualization of gastrointestinal (GI) tract images using a dataset from a medical imaging competition. The primary focus is on decoding run-length encoded (RLE) masks, associating them with the corresponding images, and visualizing these masks alongside the original images.
